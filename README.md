# AI-Agent-Project
Certainly! Here's a description of the AI Agent project based on the provided assessment document:
Project Overview:
You will be building an AI agent that can process a dataset (CSV or Google Sheet) and extract specific information from the web for each entity in a given column. The agent will leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand user queries, parse web results, and format the extracted data in a structured output.
Key Features and Requirements:
 * Dashboard for File Upload and Google Sheets Connection:
   * Users should be able to upload a CSV file or connect to a Google Sheet directly for data input.
   * The dashboard should provide a clear and intuitive interface for file upload and Google Sheet integration.
 * AI Agent Functionality:
   * The AI agent should be able to read through the uploaded dataset and identify the entities in the specified column.
   * For each entity, the agent should generate a search query based on the user-defined prompt.
   * The agent should use the LLM to parse web results and extract relevant information.
   * The extracted information should be formatted in a structured output, such as a table or a list.
 * Results Display and Download:
   * The dashboard should display the extracted information in a clear and user-friendly format.
   * Users should be able to download the results in a suitable format, such as CSV or JSON.
Additional Requirements:
 * GitHub Repository: Create a well-organized GitHub repository containing the project code, README file, and any relevant resources.
 * README File: Write a clear and comprehensive README file explaining the project's setup, usage, and key features.
 * Loom Video: Create a 2-minute video demonstrating the project's functionality and explaining key design decisions.
Overall, the goal of this project is to create a versatile AI agent that can automate information extraction from the web, making it a valuable tool for various data analysis and research tasks.
